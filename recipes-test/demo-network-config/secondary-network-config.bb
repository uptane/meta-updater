# TODO: It configures the 'user' interface in NAT mode and provides an access to public Inet via it
# which is not desired for Secondary. It cannot be just removed since we get SSH access to Secondary
# VM via this interface. So, the task is to configure the interface in such way that it does provide access
# via SSH from a host machine and forbids an access to Inet
